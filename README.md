# google-homepage
HTML/CSS project -The Odin Project

Date: May 1, 2017

Objective: Recreate Google.com's homepage using HTML and CSS. 

What I learned:

When I first started this task, I was achieving very unsatisfying results. After brainstorming on ways to keep tinkering when I had a realization that it was all about the divs! In an instant, I realized that all those divs in divs in html had a reason, and that reason was to help you achieve the desired result of your every styling wish in CSS. Armed with my epiphany, I made a new html document outlining what with a special focus on the divs. Once I had the elements created, I practiced using the Google Developer's tools to extract styling information such as colors, fonts, and sizing information. I have a newfound appreciation for how simplistic and clean the Google homepage appears to the end-user and its intricate architecture. 

Then, for fun, I opened the browser in Firefox and tinkered until my results looked uniform in both browsers.

Tested browsers:

Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
